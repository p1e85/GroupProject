     <h1>About Us</h1>
     <dl>
       <dt style="font-size:18px">From Chicago, IL</dt>
       <dd style="font-size:18px">Born and raise chicagoans, two of us created this website because we both have passion to care for dogs & cats. All animals in general but our specialty are dogs & cats</dd>
       <dt style="font-size:18px">Patrick's Info</dt>
       <dd style="font-size:18px">Currently have 2 dogs, one shih tzu mix, his name is Falkor and he is around 14 years old, he was adobted from a shelter so his real age is unknown. My second dog is Queen Buttercups or just simply Buttercups. She came from a litter of pups my mom's dog had. Originally here name was Princess Buttercups, but since then she has grown up and now at the age of 8 she was coronated Queen by my son.</dd>
       <dt style="font-size:18px">Christoper's Info</dt>
      <dd>My names Christoper Delgadillo and I have two mixed American Pitbulls. I joined with Patrick to create this website for the same shared love and passion we have for animals and out dedication to see them benefit from their owners. I got my dogs when they were new borns from a man selling them out a cardboard box, after all the approproiate shots and medical examinations they were the best thing to happen to my family. They are currently both 13 years old and live full happy lives with my family and I.</dd>
