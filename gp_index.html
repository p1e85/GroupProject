		<dd style="font-size:18px">Regardless of age require the same general basic needs: food, water, shelter, medical care, and  love.  Each species has different needs within the general basics needs.  Age can also determine what specific care your pet needs.  An kitten cat may be more active than an adult cat and therefore may need more toys to play with.  A senior dog may be less active and may need a diet change to help maintain a healthy weight.</dd>

		<dd style="font-size:18px">Adequate food for all pets in the household. You should have a separate feeding bowl for each pet. Dishes or bowls need to be cleaned at least once a day. Food must be labeled with "nutritionally complete" for your pet's stage of life as proven in AAFCO feeding trials.  As pets age, their nutritional needs will change.  It is recommended that you feed your pet a diet  that is formulated for their stage of life: Puppy/Kitten, Adult Dog/Cat, or Senior Dog/Cat.   Food recommendations may also be made based on your pet's medical history.  The veterinarian may recommend a specific prescription diet for a medical condition or reduction in the amount of food you feed to<em>help your pet maintain a healthy weight.</em></dd>

		<dd style="font-size:18px">Annual physical examination by a veterinarian, and preventative health care (tests, vaccinations, medications) as recommended at the time of examination. Pets over 7 years of age, or with known medical problems need to be examined more often. Your veterinarian can give you specific recommendations for your pet(s). <cite>Chicago IL</cite> calls <q>the finest pet info on or off the streets of Chicago</q>.</dd>
