     <h1>Cats</h1>
     <h3 style="font-size:20px"> Is a cat right for You? </h3>
     <p style="font-size:18px">Adopting a cat is essentially like getting a walking, meowing, sassy, pain reliever. Cats have known to alleviate tension in a variety of different ways purely by being themselves. When you've had a bad day, having come in and spending some time petting a fluffy feline can trigger your body to release stress-reducing hormones. Sharing the house with a fluffy feline companion offers both benefits and drawbacks. Although cats can be affectionate, friendly, loving, and fairly low-maintenance, they can also claw your sofa, shed your fur on your carpet, and urinate or defecate inside your house. Once you bring a new cat in, it's necessary to start feeding her the same amount of food on the same routine she's used to, and then slowly transition to your own food and routine. Cats are really prone to change, so a new pet must struggle with a lot of fresh-environmental tension, and keeping diet and routine constant must help her adjustment and protect her intestine.</p>
